# Welcome 👋
  
This project was started to simplify the deployment and hosting of static web applications. Over the years we've done many projects and had to go through the same process of setting up <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">**AWS**</a> to host each one individually, now we have <a href="https://servemy.site" target="_blank">**servemy.site**</a>. 

# Progress 🏗️

We are currently developing this project. 

As of right now we have a fully capable service layer that can host your projects under our own domain like <a href="https://matthew-sutton.servemy.site" target="_blank">**matthew-sutton.servemy.site**</a>. We have also recently extended out to support your own domains like <a href="https://matthew-sutton.com" target="_blank">**matthew-sutton.com**</a>.

We are still developing the web application that will allow you to interact with the service layer and host your own projects. However if you would like early access please open an issue <a href="https://github.com/servemy-site/.github/issues" target="_blank">**here**</a> and we'll get you access.
